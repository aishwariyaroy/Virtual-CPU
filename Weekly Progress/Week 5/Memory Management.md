# Memory Implementation Documentation

## Overview  
Memory segmentation divides memory into logical sections, or **segments**, to organize and manage memory efficiently. Each segment serves a specific purpose, such as storing data, code, or stack operations. This approach ensures a cleaner and more structured virtual memory space.  

---

## Key Concepts  

### 1. **Memory Segments**  
- **Code Segment**: Stores program instructions.  
- **Data Segment**: Stores variables and constants.  
- **Stack Segment**: Manages function calls, return addresses, and local variables.  

Each segment is addressed individually using segment identifiers and offsets.  

### 2. **Address Mapping**  
Memory addresses are divided into two components:  
- **Segment Identifier**: Specifies the memory segment (e.g., data, code, or stack).  
- **Offset**: Indicates the specific location within the segment.  

For example:  
```
[Segment: data, Offset: 5]
```
This refers to the **data segment** at memory address `5`.

## Features Implemented  

### 1. **Simulated Memory Space**  
Memory is organized as a single array, representing a virtual memory of fixed size.  

### 2. **Read/Write Operations**  
Data can be written to and read from specific segments using offsets.  

### 3. **Segmented Addressing**  
Every memory operation identifies the target segment and offset for precise access.  

### 4. **Printing Non-Zero Values**  
Only non-zero values in the memory are displayed, highlighting active data locations.

## Task Details  

### **Writing to Memory**  
Data is written to a specific segment and offset.  
Example:  
```
Write [Segment: data, Offset: 5] = 42  
Write [Segment: data, Offset: 10] = 84  
```

### **Reading from Memory**  
Data is read from a specific segment and offset.  
Example:  
```
Read [Segment: data, Offset: 5]: 42  
Read [Segment: data, Offset: 10]: 84  
```

### **Displaying Memory Content**  
The memory content with active data locations is printed.  
Example Output:  
```
Memory Content:  
[5]=42 [10]=84  
```

## Benefits of Memory Segmentation  

1. **Logical Organization**: Divides memory into manageable sections for better organization.  
2. **Isolation**: Ensures that code and data do not overlap unintentionally.  
3. **Scalability**: Simplifies memory management for larger memory spaces.  

---

## Example Output  

**Program Execution**:  
```
Select Task:  
1. Previous Execution Logic  
2. Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle  
3. Memory Management  
Enter choice: 3  
```  

**Output**:  
```
Testing Memory Management:  
Read Data [Segment: data, Offset: 5]: 42  
Read Data [Segment: data, Offset: 10]: 84  
Memory Content:  
[5]=42 [10]=84  
```  

---

## Future Enhancements  

1. **Dynamic Memory Segments**: Enable runtime allocation of memory segments.  
2. **Error Handling**: Validate invalid memory access and handle memory overflows effectively.  
3. **Segment Limits**: Introduce specific boundaries for each memory segment.  

---

## Conclusion  

This documentation outlines the implementation of **Memory Segmentation** for managing virtual memory in a structured way. It highlights segmented addressing, memory read/write operations, and the overall benefits of dividing memory into logical sections.
