# Features of Virtual CPU

The virtual CPU (vCPU) emulates the main functions of a physical CPU, offering a platform for testing and learning about CPU architecture and operations within a virtual environment.

## Core Features

### 1. **Basic Instruction Set** : Provides essential instructions such as `ADD`, `SUB`, `LOAD`, and `STORE`, Facilitates arithmetic operations and memory management tasks.

### 2. **Registers** : General-purpose registers temporarily hold data and operands during computations.

### 3. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** : Performs core arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logic operations (AND, OR),Emulates the processing capabilities of a real CPU.

### 4. **Program Counter (PC)** : Tracks the location of the current instruction in memory, Advances sequentially through the instruction set as each command is executed.

### 5. **Instruction Cycle** : Operates using a fetch-decode-execute cycle, Simulates the fundamental process through which a CPU runs instructions.

### 6. **Memory Management** : Includes simple memory allocation and access features, Supports read and write functions to store and retrieve data.

### 7. **Input/Output (Optional)** : Simulates basic I/O devices such as keyboards and displays, Provides simple methods for user interaction within the emulated environment.

### 8. **Assembler Support** : Contains a basic assembler to convert assembly language into machine code, Allows users to write and execute custom assembly instructions on the vCPU.
