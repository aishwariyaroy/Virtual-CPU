# Programming Language

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for developing system software, game engines, real-time applications, and embedded systems. Known for its speed and efficiency, C++ offers low-level memory manipulation and object-oriented programming, making it versatile for both high-level and low-level programming tasks.

## Tools
- **Compilers** : GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++.
- **IDEs** : Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, and CLion, which support debugging, code completion, and project management.
- **Build Systems** : CMake and Make for handling project builds.
- **Version Control** : Git for source code management and collaboration.

C++'s extensive libraries and tools make it a top choice for performance-critical applications.
